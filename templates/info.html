        <h1> How to use the scheduler?</h1>

        <b>What is the website?</b>
        
        <div>(idk the name yet) is a website that generates study schedules based on the forgetting curve. 
        The forgetting curve is a psychological concept that states that memory retention declines over time due to 
        insufficient effort to retain information. According to the graph, you forget 50% of all new information 
        within a day and 90% of all new information within a week. However, if you review and recall the information
        a day after you have studied it, the forgetting curve resets and the information is retained in your brain
        for longer. After each review, the amount of information you can remember increases.

        <b>How does the website work?</b>

        <div> The website is based on an algorithm used by the language learning app SuperMemo. It works on 
        the principle of the user entering an ‘Easiness Factor’ which represents how easy the task is, on a scale 
        of 1 to 5. The Easiness Factor is calculated by taking an average of the user’s rating for the difficulty 
        of the topic and familiarity with the topic. Then, the intervals are calculated using this formula:
        <br>
        <div id="code">
            <code>EF = (level + familiarity)/2
            <br>interval = 1
            <br>nextinterval = EF * interval
            <br>nextinterval = int(round(nextinterval))
            </code>
        </div>
        The intervals will then be displayed between the selected start and end date. For easier topics that you 
        are familiar with, the time between each study date will be longer. For more difficult topics you’re 
        unfamiliar with, the time between each date will be lesser so you can study more often and master the 
        topic.
